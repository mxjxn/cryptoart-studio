# Farcaster Mini Apps (formerly Frames v2) Quickstart by Neynar 🪐

A Farcaster Mini Apps quickstart npx script.

This is a [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) + TypeScript + React app.

## Guide

Check out [this Neynar docs page](https://docs.neynar.com/docs/create-farcaster-miniapp-in-60s) for a simple guide on how to create a Farcaster Mini App in less than 60 seconds!

## Getting Started

To create a new mini app project, run:

```bash
npx @neynar/create-farcaster-mini-app@latest
```

To run the project:

```bash
cd <PROJECT_NAME>
npm run dev
```

## Environment Setup

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with the following configuration:

```bash
# Neynar API Configuration
NEYNAR_API_KEY=your_neynar_api_key_here
NEYNAR_CLIENT_ID=your_neynar_client_id_here

# Next.js Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Tunneling Configuration for Farcaster Testing
# Set to 'true' to enable localtunnel for testing on mobile devices
USE_TUNNEL=false

# Optional: Database Configuration (if using database features)
POSTGRES_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:port/database
POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:port/database
POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING=postgresql://username:password@host:port/database

# Optional: Creator Tools APIs (if using creator tools features)
ALCHEMY_API_KEY=your_alchemy_api_key_here
CRYPTOART_HYPERSUB_CONTRACT=0x...
AIRDROP_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
```

## Testing with Farcaster

### Local Testing (Desktop)

1. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
2. Open the [Warpcast Mini App Developer Tools](https://warpcast.com/~/developers)
3. Enter your local URL: `http://localhost:3000`
4. Click "Preview" to test your mini app

### Mobile Testing (Tunneling)

To test your mini app on mobile devices or in the Warpcast mobile app, you'll need to use tunneling:

1. Set `USE_TUNNEL=true` in your `.env.local` file
2. Run `npm run dev` - this will automatically start a localtunnel
3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal:
   - Open the localtunnel URL in your browser
   - Enter your IP address in the password field
   - Click "Click to Submit"
4. Use the localtunnel URL in Warpcast Developer Tools or mobile app

**Important**: You must submit your IP address in the localtunnel password field before testing in Warpcast.

### Port Configuration

You can specify a custom port using:

```bash
npm run dev -- --port=3001
# or
npm run dev -- -p 3001
```

### Convenient Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server (uses USE_TUNNEL from .env.local)
- `npm run dev:tunnel` - Start development server with tunneling enabled
- `npm run dev:local` - Start development server with tunneling disabled
- `npm run cleanup` - Kill any processes using the development port

### Importing the CLI

To invoke the CLI directly in JavaScript, add the npm package to your project and use the following import statement:

```javascript
import { init } from '@neynar/create-farcaster-mini-app';
```

## Deploying to Vercel

For projects that have made minimal changes to the quickstart template, deploy to vercel by running:

```bash
npm run deploy:vercel
```

**For complete deployment instructions**, including environment variable setup and database configuration, see the [main deployment guide](../../DEPLOYMENT.md#cryptoart-studio-app).

## Building for Production

To create a production build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

The above command will generate a `.env` file based on the `.env.local` file and user input. Be sure to configure those environment variables on your hosting platform.

## Developing Script Locally

This section is only for working on the script and template. If you simply want to create a mini app and _use_ the template, this section is not for you.

### Recommended: Using `npm link` for Local Development

To iterate on the CLI and test changes in a generated app without publishing to npm:

1. In your installer/template repo (this repo), run:

   ```bash
   npm link
   ```

   This makes your local version globally available as a symlinked package.

2. Now, when you run:

   ```bash
   npx @neynar/create-farcaster-mini-app
   ```

   ...it will use your local changes (including any edits to `init.js` or other files) instead of the published npm version.

### Alternative: Running the Script Directly

You can also run the script directly for quick iteration:

```bash
node ./bin/index.js
```

However, this does not fully replicate the npx install flow and may not catch all issues that would occur in a real user environment.

### Environment Variables and Scripts

If you update environment variable handling, remember to replicate any changes in the `dev`, `build`, and `deploy` scripts as needed. The `build` and `deploy` scripts may need further updates and are less critical for most development workflows.
