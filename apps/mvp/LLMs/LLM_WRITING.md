### Content Guidelines

- "Cryptoart" (capitalized) for the app name
- "Farcaster mini-app" (not "dApp" or "app")
- "NFT auctions" or "auction listings"

- "STP v2 NFT" for membership (not "token" or "pass")

**Avoid**:
- "dApp" (use "mini-app" or "app")
- "Web3" (use "blockchain" or "on-chain" when needed)
- "DeFi" terminology (this is an art marketplace, not DeFi)
- Generic "crypto" terms (be specific: NFT, ETH, blockchain)

#### Style Guidelines

**Headlines**:
- Use active voice
- Be specific and benefit-focused
- Example: "Create NFT Auctions on Farcaster" not "Auction Creation Platform"

**Body Text**:
- Use second person ("you") for user-facing content
- Use present tense for features
- Break up long paragraphs
- Use bullet points for lists of features

**Technical Content**:
- Explain technical terms on first use
- Use examples to illustrate concepts
- Link to documentation when appropriate
- Avoid unnecessary technical jargon

#### Tone Examples

**Good**:
> "Create your first auction in minutes. Choose your NFT, set your price, and start accepting bids from the Farcaster community."

**Too Technical**:
> "Deploy your ERC721 or ERC1155 token to the marketplace contract via the createListing function with appropriate ListingDetails parameters."

**Too Hype**:
> "Revolutionary NFT marketplace that will change everything!"

**Better**:
> "A marketplace built for Farcaster, where artists and collectors come together."
